The big red dog took a deep breath and let out a loud howl.
The sound echoed through the forest, and the birds flew away in a flurry of feathers.
The big red dog howled again, and this time the ground shook beneath him.
The trees swayed and the leaves rustled as the sound filled the air.

The big red dog howled one more time, and this time the sky darkened and the clouds rolled in.
A bolt of lightning struck the ground, and the big red dog was gone.

The forest was silent once more, and the birds returned to their nests.
But the big red dog was never seen again, and his howl was never forgotten.

Thank you Copilot for writing this dark story.
